//! Production models.yaml-backed [`AffinityResolver`].
//!
//! SPEC §33 D9 — when the gateway config sets `gateway.models_yaml: <path>`,
//! the binary loads that file and injects this resolver into the
//! `LlmExecutor`, so a `kind: llm` executor's `affinity:` field resolves to a
//! concrete `provider:model-id` string via a Chain-of-Responsibility walk
//! over `models.yaml`. When the key is absent, the executor keeps its fail-loud
//! [`praxec_llm_executor::affinity::RejectingAffinityResolver`] default.
//!
//! The emitted prefix is the canonical catalog slug, which equals the factory
//! key [`praxec_llm_executor`]'s `DefaultProviderFactory` matches on
//! (Gemini → `"gemini"`), so [`provider_prefix`] is a pass-through over
//! `Provider::display_name()`.
